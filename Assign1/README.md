Question 1
1. I have assumed the length of the buffer to be of the size 10000000 bytes in order to 
  avoid more than required number of system calls.
2. If the path of input file is incorrect I am printing an error.
3. if the Assignment directory already exists I am changing the permissions to read,write
 and execute.
4. If the assignment directory doesnot exist I am making a new one in the same direcotry as that
 of my 'C' code.
5. If the assignment directory exists and also contains the txt file of the same name as that of
 input file, I am overwriting the file.
 6. I am making the ASSIGNMENT folder in the same directory in which I have my code.


 Question 2
 1. If the path of any of the file or directory is incorrect I am not printing permissions 
    for that and I am printing an error instead.
 2. If the read permission is not there on either of input or output files or both I am not checking them
    for reversed content.
 3. I am assuming that number of arguments given will always be three, i.e. newfile,oldfile and directory.
 4. I have considered the size of buffer again as 10000000.
